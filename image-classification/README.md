## Convolution neural network to classify images using Tensorflow.
### Project 2 of [Deep Learning Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)
#### Perry Radau
Images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  
The labelled dataset consists of 30x30 RGB images of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
The network demonstrates key principles of deep learning:
convolution layers, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
The accuracy of this convnet is 68% (compared with 10% by chance).
